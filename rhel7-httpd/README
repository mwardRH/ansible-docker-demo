Deploy Apache webserver Container using Ansible

DEMO:

1. Validate no Docker containers are running. 
$ docker ps 

2. Run ansible test. 
$ ansible local -m ping  

You should see SUCCESS in the output.  

3. Run ansible to orchistrate the container: 
$ ansible-playbook /root/ansible-docker-demo/dockerHere.yaml

4. Put external IP supplied in the OpenTLC email into your computers browser and see the httpd start page. 
Example. http://172.0.0.0/
If you see the 'Red Hat Apache Test Page' you have a successful running Apache container running, orchistrated by Ansible 2.1. 

5. Show running docker container. 
$ docker ps


BACKGROUND

This demo is intended to be very simple and to show how easy it is to use ansible to orchistrate the start of a container. 

1. The docker container was built from a docker file located in /root/dockerBuild/. You can view the Dockerfile for how it was built and the startup script. 
2. The ansible playboook is located in /root/ansible-docker-demo/. You can view the dockerHere.yaml to see the playbook an the options I used. 


STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

Environment setup: 
1. Add EPEL repo
2. Install docker, python-docker-py and ansible >= 2.1
3. Create Dockerfile and accompanying script. - For Docker use 
4. Build image file - For Docker use
5. Create Key Pair - For Ansible use
6. Copy Pubic Key using ssh-copy-id to localhost - For Ansible use 
7. Add IP and name to Ansible Hosts file. - For Ansible use
8. Test step 1. Clean up environment.
